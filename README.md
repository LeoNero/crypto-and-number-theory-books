# Crypto and number theory books - solutions
This repository will contain:
- my solutions to the book A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography (http://toc.cryptobook.us/)
- my solutions to the book An Illustrated Theory of Numbers
- my solutions to A Computational Introduction to Number Theory and Algebra
- my solutions to The Higher Arithmetic

I took a graduate-level course in Cryptography last semester and I liked it a lot,
so I will go over these books for fun.

Note: all files are handwritten notes, exported from my iPad. I'll convert them all to LaTeX one day :)
