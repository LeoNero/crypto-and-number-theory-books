My solutions to the book A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography (http://toc.cryptobook.us/)

I took a graduate-level course in Cryptography last semester and I liked it a lot,
so I will go over this book for fun.

I will go over the book during the summer and post my handwritten solutions made using my iPad.
One day I'll convert them to LaTeX.
