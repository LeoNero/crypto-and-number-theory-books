# Crypto and number theory books - solutions
This repository will contain:
- my solutions to the book A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography (http://toc.cryptobook.us/)
- my solutions to the book An Illustrated Theory of Numbers
- my solutions to A Computational Introduction to Number Theory and Algebra
- my solutions to The Higher Arithmetic
- my solutions to Elliptic Curves - Number Theory and Cryptography

I took a graduate-level course in Cryptography last semester and I liked it a lot,
so I will go over these books for fun.

I will go over the book during the summer and post my handwritten solutions made using my iPad.
One day I'll convert them to LaTeX.
